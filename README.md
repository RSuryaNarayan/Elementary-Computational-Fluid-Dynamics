# Elementary-Computational-Fluid-Dynamics
This is a repository of MATLAB codes that contains some popular CFD problems one usually encounters when learning CFD for the first time. Includes projects that use the Finite Volume Method for discretization. Convection-diffusion problems with Channel flow and Driven-cavity flow can be found too. 
All Problems are dealt at the steady state. 
Navier Stokes Solver uses a pressure-velocity-coupled method called SIMPLE.Interpolation schemes explored include: upwinding (first order accurate) and central differencing (second-order accurate).
